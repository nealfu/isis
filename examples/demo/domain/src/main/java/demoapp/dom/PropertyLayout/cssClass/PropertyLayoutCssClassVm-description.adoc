JAXB supports `Character` out-of-the-box, so no special annotations are required.

[source,java]

include::WrapperCharacterViewModel.java[tags=class]
----
<.> a no-arg constructor is required by JAXB
<.> required property as defined to JAXB
<.> directly editable property as defined to Apache Isis
<.> optional property as defined to Apache Isis.

This is the default for JAXB so no additional annotation required.
