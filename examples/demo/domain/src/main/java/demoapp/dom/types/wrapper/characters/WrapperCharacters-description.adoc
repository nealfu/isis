The framework has built-in support for all of the Wrapper data types, including `Character`.

From here you can:

* navigate to an entity that uses the `Character` datatype
* open a view model that uses the `Character` datatype

Some properties on these domain objects are mandatory, some optional.

== Common interface

These objects both implement a common interface, `StringHolder`:

[source,java]
----
include::holder/WrapperCharacterHolder.java[tags=class]
----

The default methods have annotations that automatically inherited.
Using `@MemberOrder` positions the properties into the appropriate `<field-set>` within the `Xxx.layout.xml` layout file.


== Mixin actions

A number of mixin actions contribute through this interface, demonstrate the use of `Character` as a parameter and as a return type.
For example:

* the `updateReadOnlyPropertyPromptStyleInline` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/WrapperCharacterHolder_updateReadOnlyOptionalProperty.java[tags=class]
----
+
There are a number of variants of this action, to demonstrate different prompt layouts.

* the `actionReturning` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/WrapperCharacterHolder_actionReturning.java[tags=class]
----


* the `actionReturningCollection` action is:
+
[source,java]
----
include::holder/WrapperCharacterHolder_actionReturningCollection.java[tags=class]
----
